1.This is a single page application and hence faster transitions and the resources ar dynamically loaded and added to the page as necessary
2.The application rewrites sections of a page and does not fully reload when using the navbar links, hence boosting the performance of the application.
3.A react-router has been deployed to navigate between different components, changing the browser URL, modifying the browser history, and keeping the UI state in sync.
4.Fetch API has been used to fetch resources asynchronously across the network from the given API endpoint.
5.The application is built with several reusable components.
6.JSX has been used as the templating language configured with Babel.
7.Usage of React hooks to re-use stateful logic and hence the code is reusable and easy to read.
8.The application is fully responsive(achieved using media queries)
9.Most of the content is dynamically loaded from Data.js file and hence this file can be referenced as an endpoint from headless cms or a table from a database.
